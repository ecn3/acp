Start with testDB

- Automate creation of a database table using attributes of a class
-Use Jav Relection API
- Allow runable from command prompt
- Refactor into a modularized program with classes and methods
Methods:
createTable
addRecords
issueQuery

- Create a user manual
- Create a batch file to run program

Classes:
Vehicle
make (values: Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai) size (values: compact, intermediate, fullSized), weight (double), engineSize (double) and import (boolean). 

No negative numbers

Vehicle:
+Enum make;
+Enum size;
+double weight;
+double engineSize;
+boolean import;


- Use java serialzation to create disk file with ten vehicles that randomly selecting makes and models(size) from the above enumerations, and randomly select weights between 1500 and 4000 pounds. Weights must be such that compact cars (1500-2000) weigh less than intermediate cars (2000-2500) and intermediate cars weigh less than the rest. Full-sized cars are in the weight range (2500-4000). Create the 10 instances of class Vehicle and write them to a disk file named Vehicles.dat.
===
randMake = 1,5;
randSize = 1,3;
randWeight = 1500,4000;
	if is size compact
		randWeight = 1500,2000;
	if is size intermediate
		randWeight = 2000,2500;
	if is size fullSized
		randWeight = 2500,4000;

if randMake 1 OR 2 randImport = FALSE;
else randImport = TRUE;


- write to dbOperations.log when:
all table creation, addition of values, queries, table deletions

-batch file
create vechiles
write them to vehicles.dat
extract instance fields to create database table using SQL
read vehicles
add vehicles to table using SQL commands
SQL queries to display:
•	all the vehicles that have been stored in the database.
•	all Chevys and Toyotas
•	all vehicles weighing more than 2500 pounds

add querys to log
display log
no user interaction
system.oput what you are doing
