User runs server from command prompt, pulls up http://localhost:4200
Server sends alert("ready to accept players for the game");

User starts a client that logs into server from command prompt x 2

JavaFX GUI ask user for name, send name to server

Once server has 2 clients accepts move commands (int player, int row, int column)
if (lastMove player == 1){player = 2);
if (lastMove player == 2){player = 1);
if(row > 2 || row < 0){take in row again); // math.round to nearest whole number
if(column> 2 || column< 0){take in column again); // math.round to nearest whole number
